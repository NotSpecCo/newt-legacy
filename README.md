# Newt

#### What is it?
Newt is a replacement for Google Chrome's 'new tab' page that displays your favorite bookmarks, apps, most-visited sites, recently-added bookmarks, recently-closed tabs, and tabs/windows from your other devices. Since this app has to load every time you open a new tab, the focus was mostly on keeping things simple, lightweight, and fast. The last thing you want is to have to wait a second or two each time you open a tab, right?

#### How do I build this?

Simple! All you need to have is Node.js and Gulp installed, then run the below command. The final product will be in the newly-created 'deploy' folder.
